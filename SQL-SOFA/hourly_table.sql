-- This query generates a row for every hour the patient is in the ICU.
-- The hours are based on clock-hours (i.e. 02:00, 03:00).
-- The hour clock starts 24 hours before the first heart rate measurement.
-- Note that the time of the first heart rate measurement is ceilinged to the hour.
-- this query extracts the cohort and every possible hour they were in the ICU
-- this table can be to other tables on ICUSTAY_ID and (ENDTIME - 1 hour,ENDTIME]
